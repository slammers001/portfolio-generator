## 🏁 Beginning

If you are going to want to create multiple portfolios with different styles (there are 12 possibilities) then it would make sense to fork this repo. Because after you generate a portfolio, it saves it in a new folder in the root directory, called for example `slammers001-portfolio`. If you want to have multiple (or try some out) then it would make sense to fork so all your portfolio generations are saved.


## 🛠️ Installation  

Begin by running in project root:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the generator with:  

```bash
npx ts-node src/generator.ts
```
Follow the prompts to set up your website.
(After inputting all information, it may take 1-2 minutes to install everything that you will need for your website.
It's fully normal, and should not take more than 3 minutes max.)

## 🚀 Usage
After generation, navigate to your new website folder:

```bash
cd /path/to/your-website
```
Start the dev server:

```bash
npm start
```
Your site will be live at http://localhost:3000 (port may vary if 3000 is already in use).
